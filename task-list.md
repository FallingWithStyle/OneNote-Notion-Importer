## Notes
- Use `- [ ]` for incomplete tasks, `- [x]` for completed tasks.
- Keep tasks directly under the Story they belong to.
- Match Story IDs (`Story 1.1`, etc.) with the PRD for easy alignment.
- Update frequently to keep the Task List and PRD in sync.
- **TDD Methodology**: All development follows Red-Green-Refactor cycle as specified in each epic goal
- Prioritize Epic 1 and 2 for MVP delivery.
- Epic 4.2 (GUI) is optional and can be deferred to post-MVP.
- Maintain > 90% test coverage for all core modules.
